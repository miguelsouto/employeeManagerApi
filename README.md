# employeeManagerApi
An API for manager employees.

It is a maven project that was implemented in Java 11 using SpringBoot.

This project was generated with [sprint initializr](https://start.spring.io/) on version 2.4.2.

There are endpoints to:
* List all employees;
* Find only one employee by his ID;
* Insert a new employee;
* Update existing employees;
* Delete one employee by his ID.

The SpringJpa was used to help with all of endpoints.

To run this application you must have a springboot plugin in your IDE, and run it as a springboot project and make sure that the 8080 port is free of process.
